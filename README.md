# TicTacToe-Game ðŸ¤–
A classic Tic-Tac-Toe game built in Java, where a player competes against the computer. This version features a strategic AI that makes "smart moves" based on the player's choices to enhance gameplay.

**Features**

* **Single-player mode**: Player vs. Computer.
  
* **Smart AI Moves**: The computer intelligently chooses moves to win or block the player, taking advantage of available spots.
* **Efficient Code Structure**: Simplified code with reduced redundancy, making it easier to understand and maintain.

**Game Rules**
1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
2. The player and computer take turns marking a cell.
    * Player: Marks cells with an "X".
    * Computer: Marks cells with an "O".
3. The first to align three marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins.
4. If all cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a tie.

**Code Highlights**

The smartMove() function in this Tic-Tac-Toe game employs a strategic decision-making algorithm that enables the computer to play intelligently, considering both winning and blocking moves. This is done in a systematic way with prioritized choices, making the AI more challenging and efficient.
